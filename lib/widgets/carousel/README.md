##Overview:
This repository contains a library that was originally developed by another author and later downloaded for analysis,
experimentation, and potential extension. The purpose of this project is to maintain a structured and well-documented environment
for working with the library while preserving the integrity of the original implementation.
All credits for the initial design, logic, and source code belong to the original creator.



##Technical Purpose:
The primary technical objective of this repository is to provide a stable environment for inspecting the internal architecture
of the library, understanding its modules, and extending its capabilities where necessary.
This includes refactoring certain components, improving code readability, enhancing performance,
or integrating the library into larger systems. Any modifications introduced in this repository will be carefully documented
to distinguish them from the original source.



##Architecture Notes:
The repository may introduce additional layers such as build scripts, configuration files, automated testing utilities,
or integration points to facilitate development workflows. These additions aim to improve maintainability and scalability
without interfering with the core functionality. When applicable, comments or annotations will be added to clarify
the behavior of key components, dependencies, and data flows.




##Licensing and Attribution:
This project is not intended for redistribution or commercial use unless explicitly permitted by the original author.
The purpose of hosting this library here is strictly for research, evaluation, and development purposes.
If the original creator requests removal, attribution changes, or restrictions, all such requests will be honored immediately.
